Probabilistic numerical methods have experienced a recent surge of interest. However,
the literature of many key contributions date back to 60s-80s, a period before
many modern developments in computing. The goal here is to collect a relevant, organized reading list here. I hope to update
this post with more references and possibly short descriptions of the papers as
I get to reading more of them.

The [Probabilistic Numerics Website](http://probabilistic-numerics.org/literature/index.html) has a more complete set of papers and serves as a great reference on this topic.

# Recent surveys

Here are recent surveys that collect a lot of the literature and developments in the field as well as open problems the authors believe are important to tackle.

   uncertainty in computations. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A:
   Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 471(2179).

# Selected historical papers

The first discussion of probabilistic numerics apparently dates back to
Poincar&eacute; in 1896. Here we collect some important papers building
foundations in probabilistic numerics, which mostly focused on the problem of integration.

# Recent papers on probabilistic numerics

For lack of a better title, here we collect more recent papers on probabilistic numerics, focusing on
general overviews, rather than specific methods (to be added later).
